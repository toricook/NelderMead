An implementation of the [Simplex Method for Function Minimization proposed by Nelder and Mead](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308). The goal of this implementation is to create straightforward code that can be easily modified in order to test variations on the algorithm and adapt it to specific problems. 
Usage examples forthcoming. In the meantime, enjoy this gif of the solver finding a local minimum of Himmelbrau's function.
